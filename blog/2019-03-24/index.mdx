If the Mayans have taught us anything, it is that if you don't finish something, it's not the end of the world. #monkeywisdom #writemonkey

- Apple iPad mini 5 has been released. Just a spec bump upgrade. Hm.
- Made my first reservation with the [GMovies][1] app. Such a poorly implemented app. Used a voucher code from ShareTreats to save on the ticket price. Oh, and the movie is Avengers: Endgame.
- Bought my first ever powerbank: Pineng PN-953 10000mah for 339 pesos
- Netflix Premium Ultra HD now at home! Downgraded [iTunes for Windows to old version 12.6.5.3][2] to be able to install last-compatible Netflix version on iPad 4. First movie shown at home with Netflix? High School Musical 3. What else?

> At a time when nearly all his contemporaries held to the view that "error has no rights," Castellio's plea for toleration and respect for the rights of conscience was certainly exceptional. "To force conscience is worse than cruelly to kill a man," he wrote, "because I must be saved by my own faith and not by that of another... Religion resides not in the body but in the heart, which cannot be reached by the sword of kings and princes. The Church can no more be constructed by persecution and violence than walls can be built by cannon blasts." When Calvin asked how then was the true church to be recognized, Castellio answered, "By an assured faith concerning things which are hoped for, not known, by love which is better than faith and may be clearly discerned, by the doctrine of piety which is to love your enemies, bless those who curse you, to hunger and thirst after righteousness and endure persecution for righteousness' sake."
