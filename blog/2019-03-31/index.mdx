Netflix, HOOQ and iflix! Thank you Camtasia.

- [Roku Express][1] making our not so smart TV really smart. A ton of channels. Awesome. Not a cordcutter yet though.
- Using [Infuse][2] free app with SMB share on laptop to watch movies on iPad. Plex what?
- A bunch of orders made in Lazada birthday sale. Apparently, I'm not good enough of a gamer to win the 2,777 pesos voucher. So close though.
- [Shopee Quiz][3] experiences its first technical glitch which rewards the wrong quizzers. A test of character for them. They already apologized and gave discount vouchers to all those affected.
- My Oppo 1201 phone still getting a new system update in 2019.
- Pope Francis is 'First Pope To Write a Line of Code' [(geekwire.com)][4] - TWiT #711

### *"ink"*
> When I first found out I had cancer, I didn't know what to pray for. I didn't know if I should pray for healing or life or death. Then I found peace in praying for what my folks call "God's perfect will." As it evolved, my prayer has become, "Lord, let me live until I die." By that I mean I want to live, love, and serve fully until death comes. If that prayer is answered... how long really doesn't matter. Whether it's just a few months or a few years is really immaterial.
