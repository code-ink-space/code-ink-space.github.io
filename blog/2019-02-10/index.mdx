- [WriteMonkey 3][1] is quite a big change from version 2. I think the move away from simply using plain text files might be a big mistake. Meanwhile, [Prolific][2] is looking really good right now.

### *"ink"*
> John says of the world, not that it is wrong, but simply that it "passeth away." There is a great deal in the world that is delightful and beautiful; there is a great deal in it that is great and engrossing; but it will not last. All that is in the world, the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life, are but for a little while. Love not the world therefore. Nothing that it contains is worth the life and consecration of an immortal soul. The immortal soul must give itself to something that is immortal. And the only immortal things are these: "Now abideth faith, hope, love, but the greatest of these is love."
> 
> &mdash; Henry Drummond, "The Greatest Thing in The World" (1880)
