I'm now moving to an irregular schedule. Updates will come as enough new stuff worth writing about is ready.

### &lt;/code&gt;
- [Lunescope][1] Android app is awesome and thank God for the Apollo 11 sale
- I wish Philippine libraries provided services like Kanopy, Hoopla, Libby, cloudLibrary, PressReader, RBdigital, etc.
- Finally (nervously) rooted an Android phone. Downgraded the firmware first because the latest disables fastboot. Used Magisk. Thankfully the full backup works. I won't be needing custom recovery on this one (yet).
- Managing cloud storage with [FX File Explorer][2] Android app
- Setup three WiFi networks at home again using the PLDT router, that old Linksys and TP-Link AC750. Channel 5 for main and channel 13 for the other two. Picked these channels based on recommendations by WiFi Overview 360 and WiFi Analyzer. I would have used channel 13 entirely if Roku would use it! Had to install CommView for WiFi drivers just to get Windows 10 to detect channel 13. System regional settings are being ignored by the network adapter it seems.
- [VPN Hotspot][3] from XDA Labs is a godsend.
- Did a ton of work on my first [Raspberry Pi 3 B+][4]. More details on the next issue.
