It's official. How To Train Your Dragon is one of the greatest movie trilogies of all-time. #HTTYD3

### &lt;/code&gt;
- In the past, I briefly participated in SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence). Trying this out again in [BOINC][1] (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing) with a preference for Astronomy and Earth sciences research.
- Thank you [Blinkist][2] for the helpful summaries. Maybe one day when the subscription fee is more reasonable for third world countries, I'll subscribe again.
- [Google My Maps][3] is indispensable for planning trips especially vacations. Though I wish editing the map was just as easy on their mobile apps. Seems like Google already neglected the development there.
