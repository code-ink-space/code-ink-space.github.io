*Captain Marvel* was alright. I don't understand the negative reviews. Maybe they just had completely different expectations about her character and personality. Still unforgivable though that she stole all IMAX screens from *How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World*.

### &lt;/code&gt;
- From now on: Use GCash AMEX for Spotify and Google Play only. Use PayMaya VISA for most online transactions. I've had enough of GCash AMEX failed transactions.
- Trying out [Photobook][1]. Hope the pictures come out fine. It will be delivered via DHL tomorrow. Priority Express!
- Made my first online purchase of a home appliance at [Lazada][2]. It's an old model of a 3D ceiling fan (Aeromaster 56 III) for my brother, a gift from our sister. We've yet to install it.

> “Even when reading is impossible, the presence of books acquired produces such an ecstasy that the buying of more books than one can read is nothing less than the soul reaching towards infinity... We cherish books even if unread, their mere presence exudes comfort, their ready access reassurance.”
> 
> &mdash; Alfred Edward Newton, American author, publisher, and avid book collector
