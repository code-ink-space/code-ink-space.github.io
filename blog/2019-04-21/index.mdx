Started watching *Brooklyn Nine-Nine* and *Hilda* on Netflix. Better late than never.

### &lt;/code&gt;
- [TheTVDB][1] signup to add *Sana Maulit Muli* to Trakt.tv.
- No DD-WRT OpenVPN support for my old Linksys WRT54G2 v1.0 router:
> "It only has a 2MB flash, you won't get anything bigger than micro on it." - [dd-wrt forum][2]
- Netflix blocks ProtonVPN connection. Windscribe restricts mobile hotspot feature to paid users only, it seems. Back to Getflix DNS setup on PLDT router but with Netflix US still disabled.
- HBO Go on Roku is only for US. No [HBO GO Asia][3] Roku channel. But I now have access to complete Game of Thrones and all live HBO TV channels! Watching on iPad. Still have some use for SkyCable after all.
- Reset Windows Firewall to defaults for Emby on Roku to work. Thanks [Emby forum][4].
- Amazon Prime Video 30-day free trial signup (also activated on Roku) just to watch [Jesus of Nazareth (1977)][5]. So much more selections than Netflix PH because it's Prime Video US and Getflix gives it even on trial.
- [Deimos 1980 - 2018][6]
>  You will be forever missed!
Demonoid April 21, 2003 - September 17, 2018
Our comeback kid Demonoid will now rest after years of fighting along with his father.
With great sadness we want to announce that Deimos, the owner of Demonoid has died on August, 2018 at age of 38.
