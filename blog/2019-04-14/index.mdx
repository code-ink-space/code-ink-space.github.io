Watched my first series on iWant: *Ikaw Lang ang Iibigin*. Their apps and website need a lot of work though. So many usability issues. E-mailed feedback.

### &lt;/code&gt;
- Managed to hack my way into PLDT's router again. Someone blogged the latest passwords. Needed it to change the DNS. Admin access gets reset after a router restart but the DNS settings thankfully persist. I don't have the time nor the patience to be contacting support with waiver forms and whatnot.
- [Getflix][1] free trial lets me watch more Roku US channels. But I need a paid Getflix subscription to be able to watch US Netflix in HD. Oh well, sticking to Netflix PH for now.
- [The Google Cemetery][2] welcomes [Inbox][3].
- [Haystack TV][4] on Roku is really cool. Consolidated news from many outlets all in one channel.
- [AppAdvice][5] is so great right now. #iOS
- [Audible Australia][6] 1 month promo for $1. Paid 54.01p through GCash AMEX. 1 credit to use before May 11.
- Subscribed to [iWant][7] Premium for 30 days using Kapamilya Thank You voucher bought for 99 points.
- Thunderstorm in the afternoon. Good prediction by [Flowx][8]! Promising app.
